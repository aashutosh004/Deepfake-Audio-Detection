# Deepfake-Audio-Detection
The objective is to classify audio samples as either 'REAL' or 'FAKE' using deep learning techniques. This involves preprocessing audio data, designing a neural network model, and training the model to distinguish between real and fake audio.

## Dataset : DEEP-VOICE: Real-time Detection of AI-Generated Speech for DeepFake Voice Conversion
This dataset contains examples of real human speech, and DeepFake versions of those speeches by using Retrieval-based Voice Conversion.
