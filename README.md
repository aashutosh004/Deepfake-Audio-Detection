# Deepfake-Audio-Detection
This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning model for detecting deepfake audio. The model uses a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to analyze and classify audio data into REAL and FAKE categories.

## Overview
Deepfake audio detection has become an increasingly important area of research due to the rise in manipulated media. This project aims to build a robust model that can effectively distinguish between real and fake audio using MFCC (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients) features.

## Dataset : DEEP-VOICE: Real-time Detection of AI-Generated Speech for DeepFake Voice Conversion
This dataset contains examples of real human speech, and DeepFake versions of those speeches by using Retrieval-based Voice Conversion.

## Credits
This project is a modified version of a codebase originally authored by [Surendar14]. The original implementation provided a foundation for building this deepfake audio detection model. I have made several modifications to improve the model's performance and tailor it to my specific needs.
